### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
> User stories digest the needs of the project into small parts that can easily be converted into tasks that the developers can implement directly into the product.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
> I'm going to incorporate better organization through time-boxing and daily standups and retrospectives, not just in my future development work but to manage my time more effectively in general.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
> A good team member makes a fair contribution to the overall working of the whole project. The team benefits much more with the team member than they would without them.
